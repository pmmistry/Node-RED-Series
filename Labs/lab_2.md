# Node-RED Dashboards and UI Techniques 
Dashboards are incredibly useful in a variety of industries. They provide incredible visual insight into applications functionalities and are a great way to measure metrics, visualize data, get alerted with updates and drill down into important details all in one place. Creating effective dashboards for your API driven applications can get pretty tricky and might require a lot of effort and front-end development knowledge. However, Node-RED’s UI nodes makes it effective and easy for anyone to create informative visualizations and within minutes! 

In this lab we will be walking through various different things you can make using Node-RED dashboards!

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login?cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg) (IBM Cloud Lite, trial, or paid account).

Please go through [Get Started with Node-RED on IBM Cloud](https://github.com/pmmistry/Node-RED-Series#get-started-with-node-red-on-ibm-cloud) to get an instance of Node-RED running on IBM Cloud. 

## Lab 
In this lab we are going to be building useer interfaces using [Node-RED Dashboard Nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard) 

The Node-RED Dashboard nodes provide a very intuitive and effective way to mock up user interfaces for event driven applications. 

First thing that you will need to get started is to install `node-red-dashboard` nodes into your Node-RED Editor. 

To do this you will need to 
1. Go to manage palette in your Node-RED Editor
